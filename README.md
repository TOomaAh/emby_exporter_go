# Emby Exporter

Hi there!
At first sorry if the development of the project is slow. I am a student and unfortunately I have very little time for myself! I'll probably rewrite some code a few times, I'll probably stop working on it for a while and start again but I'll finish this project because I need it.

Basically: Emby is TOP! But some things are missing like a metric exporter.

Currently the project doesn't look like much but ONE DAY it will be perfect. If you want to help me go ahead ! Little Pull Request and it's done. Any help is good to take !

Thanks for your patience <3
